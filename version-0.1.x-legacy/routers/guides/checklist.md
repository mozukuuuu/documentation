# Checklist for Running a Router

* [Spin up the router](../../../versioned\_docs/version-0.1.x-legacy/routers/Guides/spinning-up/) and [configure](../../../versioned\_docs/version-0.1.x-legacy/routers/Reference/configuration/) for testnets.
* [Provide Liquidity](../../../versioned\_docs/version-0.1.x-legacy/routers/Guides/providing-liquidity/) and gas fees on testnets.
* [Test the router](../../../versioned\_docs/version-0.1.x-legacy/routers/Guides/testing-router/) on testnets.
* Change configuration to mainnets (use a different mnemonic!), or spin up a new mainnet router.
* Provide liquidity on mainnets.
* [Monitor router logs](../../../versioned\_docs/version-0.1.x-legacy/routers/Guides/spinning-up/#view-logs) and [Grafana](../../../versioned\_docs/version-0.1.x-legacy/routers/Guides/spinning-up/#grafana-dashboard).
* Make sure to fill with gas when it's low!.
