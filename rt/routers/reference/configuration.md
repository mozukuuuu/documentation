# 構成

The router is accepts configuration using the config file `config.json` in the root directory of the [docker-compose repo](https://github.com/connext/nxtp-router-docker-compose).

See the [testnet](../../../kai-fa-zhe/developers/testing-against-testnet.md) or mainnet (coming soon) guides for addresses and URLs.

The JSON schema accepts the following keys:

* `sequencerUrl`: The URL of the sequencer.
* `redis`: _Requires_. Object containing the following keys to configure an external redis instance:
  * `host`: The hostname of the redis instance.
  * `port`: The port of the redis instance.
* `server`: _Required_. Object containing the following keys to configure the HTTP server:
  * `adminToken`: _Required_. Secret token used to authenticate admin requests.
  * `port`: _Optional_. The port the router will listen on. Defaults to `8080`.
  * `host`: _Optional_. The host the router will listen on. Defaults to `0.0.0.0`.
  * `requestLimit`: _Optional_. Unused.
* `web3SignerUrl`: _Recommended_. The URL for a running [Web3Signer](https://docs.web3signer.consensys.net/en/latest/) instance. This is the recommended approach to private key storage.
* `mnemonic`: _Optional, Discouraged_. The mnemonic used to generate the private key. Using the mnemonic directly in the config file is unsafe and not recommended.
* `chains`: _Required_. The chain configuration. A JSON object with the following keyed by [Domain IDs](../../../docs/routers/Reference/developers/testing-against-testnet/#domain-ids) with the following object schema as value:
  * `providers`: _Required_. An array of providers URLs for a chain. Use a minimum of 1 URL, but additional URLs provide more fallback protection against provider issues.
  * `assets`: _Required_. An array of assets. Each asset is a JSON object with the following keys:
    * `assetId`: _Required_. The asset ID (ERC20 token address). For native assets, use `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`.
    * `name`: _Required_. The Asset Name.
    * `mainnetEquivalent`: _Optional_. The equivalent asset on ETH mainnet for price determinations. Defaults to Connext's configuration.
  * `subgraph`: _Optional_. An object containing the following keys to configure subgraphs.
    * `runtime`: _Optional_. An array of subgraph URLs for a chain. Additional URLs provide more fallback protection against subgraph issues. If not provided, will default to Connext's hosted subgraphs.
    * `analytics`: _Optional_. An array of subgraph URLs for a chain. Additional URLs provide more fallback protection against subgraph issues. If not provided, will default to Connext's hosted subgraphs.
    * `maxLag`: _Optional_. The number of blocks to allow the subgraph's latest block number to be behind the provider's latest block number. Defaults to the recommended value per chain.
  * `deployments`: _Optional_. An object containing the following keys to configure deployments.
    * `connext`: _Optional_. The address of the Connext.sol contract. If not provided, will default to the latest deployed contracts.
  * `confirmations`: _Optional_. The number of confirmations required for a transaction to be considered valid on a chain. Defaults to defined values [here](https://github.com/connext/chaindata/blob/29cc0250aff398cdf9326dcb7698d291f3e3015a/crossChain.json).
  * `minGas`: _Optional_. The minimum gas amount required to be held by the router's signer address in order to participate in auctions, specified in Wei. Defaults to `100000000000000000` (0.1 Ether).
  * `gasStations`: _Optional_. Array of gas station URLs, defaults to using the RPC's gas estimation.
* `subgraphPollInterval`: _Optional_. Control the subgraph poll interval in milliseconds. Defaults to 15\_000 (15 seconds).
* `maxSlippage`: _Optional_. The maximum amount of slippage to allow in transfers.
