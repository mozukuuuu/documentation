## Test Token (TEST)

The Test ERC20 Token has an open mint function with the signature `mint(address account, uint256 amount)`. These test ERC20 tokens can be freely minted by anyone and they are collateralized by routers on the test network to enable swaps between them on the different chains.

Please ping the team to request for more testnet assets and swaps added!
