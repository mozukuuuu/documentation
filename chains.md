# Supported Chains

At mainnet launch we aim to have chain parity to our current mainnet, supporting all major 17 chains we support right now. During the transitionary period until then, we only support Ethereum Testnet chains.

## Supported Tokens & Deployed Contracts

At mainnet launch we aim to have chain parity to our current mainnet, supporting all tokens (and more!) we currently support. During the transitionary period until then, we only support the $TEST token. Contracts for the $TEST token can be found on our [testing against testnet page](docs/developers/testing-against-testnet/)

### How do I add my chain to Connext?
