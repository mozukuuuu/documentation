# Connext Subgraph Introduction

Connext  has a GraphQL API Endpoint hosted by [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/docs/about/introduction#what-the-graph-is) called a subgraph for indexing and organizing data from the Connext smart contracts.

This subgraph is can be used to query Connext bridge transactions, transactions statuses and more.

Subgraph information is serviced by a decentralized group of server operators called Indexers - and thus our decentralized application also has decentralized data endpoints.
